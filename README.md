This lab implements the equivalent of CControl on the Raspberry Pi using the PIGPIO system. Using the PIGPIO system, implement digital input and output, servo control and the SPI ADC MCP3008 for analog to digital conversion. You must setup a test procedure for CControlPi exactly as you have done (you can re-use the code) for the CControl class in Lab 3 - Embedded Control. You can use the MSP432 Boosterpack using joysticks as analog input, the pushbuttons and the LEDâ€™s to simplify the wiring
